G) Glossary, Abbreviations and Spanish Terms (Translated Labels)

We could have these in some sort of a document and tag them.
1- Ingresar: it means enter, which is a common button label for “Login”, in other words it means enter to the platform.
2- RUC: It’s an abbreviation for “El Registro Único de Contribuyentes”, which literally means The Unique Registry of Taxpayers, this is the Tax Number that could be linked to a person or a company. Finsmart context: We use RUC as the username to login for the clients, since any client that uses the platform is a legal company that must have a RUC so they can issue invoices, later on they utilize Finsmart to get advance on the invoices they issue with a collection date that is relatively far in the future.
3- Market Place: This refers to the invoices that are seen by the investor which are ready to be invested in, after they pass the invoice approval and configuration process.
4- T&C: Terms and Conditions.

5- Code Glossary: 
- loginId is the label for the property that could hold the first part of credentials, that could either hold (email, ruc, username)
