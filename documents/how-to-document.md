AS) General Documentation Conventions: 
	THIS SHOULD BE A STANDARD FOR DOCUMENTATION QUALITY
* 1) Text wrapped between back-ticks might either mean a code snippet, a business term or a template if mixed with square brackets (See point 2).
* 2) Any text wrapped in a square brackets means a place holder, so if you see `[title]-FS[issue-number]`.
* 3) names and placeholders will always be hyphened.
* 4) In any template (point 1), a text outside a placeholder is always case sensitive.
